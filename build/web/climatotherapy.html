<blockquote>
<p>Climatotherapy is a performance installation developed from Nozomu
Matsumoto’s <a href="https://boomkat.com/products/climatotherapy"
target="_blank">recent release on The Death of Rave (RAVE024)</a>.  </p>
<p>The word ‘climatotherapy’ refers to a type of physical and mental
treatment which utilizes the influence of climate on the human body,
exemplified by treatments in the Dead Sea or at hot springs. Comprised
of sound, light, smell, ikebana and Nozomu’s 1-to-1 private concerts
taking place periodically throughout the duration of the piece, virtual
assistant Alexa is a key component, repurposed to generate live and
enunciate various suggestions and tips throughout, what we should do,
how we should live.</p>
<p>With these elements in dialogue, the installation becomes its own
microclimate. Populated by household audio technologies, corporate
messages weave through musical reproductions to create an ever-changing
soundtrack for our relationship with ever-changing technologies. As our
preference settings hack, repurpose and adapt our technological world
into new causes, these devices become an aesthetic, a physical
manifestation of the dialogue between mass industry and human
environment. Climatotherapy questions how the human body is conditioned
by its environment in the time and space of cloudified body, mind, and
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jakub, Henry and I worked on producing a custom Alexa skill and a set
of audio events which would trigger it, which accompanied the
soundtrack, performance and physical installation produced by Nozomu and
Nile.</p></main>
