A collaboration with [Sally Golding](https://sallygolding.com/){target="_blank"}, [Spatial](http://spatial.infrasonics.net/){target="_blank"}, and [Cenatus](https://cenatus.org){target="_blank"} – [Assembly Now \[online\]](https://metroarts.com.au/assembly-now-online/){target="_blank"} is a virtual experience of [Sally](https://sallygolding.com/){target="_blank"} & [Spatial’s](http://spatial.infrasonics.net/){target="_blank"} recent installation, which inaugurated Metro Arts’ Gallery One at West Village, as part of Brisbane Festival 2020, on view during September, 2020.

Simulating and expanding the physical installation, participants in the online version are immersed in a work that plays with perception, interactivity and unexpected encounters – including the viewer’s own reflection captured and integrated within the artwork.

Assembly Now \[online\] uses the interface of the mirror to elaborate the psychology and technology of emergent algorithmic software, which functions as a contemporary screen filtering our emotions.

We live in an age of ubiquitous photography– selfie culture, and surveillance capitalism– facial recognition and eye tracking. Emotion analytics software used in neuro-marketing and image recognition is a blend of psychology and technology– capturing data on expression, to assume correlations in mood determined by machine learning.
