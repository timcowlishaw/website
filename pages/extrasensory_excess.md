_Extrasensory Excess / Excesos Extrasensoriales: Imagining inclusions with discarded data_ is a collaborative research and prototyping project I ran for the [Medios Sintientes](https://mediossintientes.medialab-matadero.es/){target="_blank"} programme at [Medialab Matadero](https://www.medialab-matadero.es/){target="_blank"} in Madrid. It is an investigation into the _blind spots_ of the sensory systems of the city of Madrid, through its public open data portal – investigating and critiquing its exclusions, and things left out. Taking this as a starting point, we speculated about and made concrete proposals for alternative worlds which are more just and inclusive of agencies both human and more-than-human. Through a participatory process of research and co-creation, we invented devices and probes that perceive the world in a more inclusive manner than existing systems, as well as offering a glimpse of the alternative worlds that this expanded perception might permit.
