_Marco_ is a slow, asynchronous communication system for to help maintain a connection with friends and loved ones who are far away. It's a photo frame which sits in your friend's home, and to which you can send a message (text, a photograph, a drawing, or some combination of these) at any time, via a web interface.

Made from a Raspberry Pi, a WaveShare e-ink screen, a John Lewis photo frame, and sundry bits of cardboard, hot glue, javascript and python. It's [open source](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/marco){target="_blank"} if you'd like to make your own.
