### Made by Machine: When AI met the archive (2018)
#### Project with BBC R&D

During my time at BBC R&D, Cassian Harrison, Controller of BBC Four, challenged us to produce a one-hour documentary programme, assembled from existing archive clips, entirely using machine learning techniques:

This was an interesting exercise in testing the limits of computational creativity, and in the use of machine learning on media to educate a non-specialist public about the technology, it's strengths, weaknesses, and possible risks.

Alongside my editorial colleague Caroline Alton, I led the team which put the film together: investigating, devising and implementing the machine learning technology which produced the film itself.

We used a variety of different approaches to do this, including computer vision and natural language processing, techniques, as well as adapting recent deep neural network-based sequence learning techniques to model the sequence of transmissions in our film. [All the details](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-10-artificial-intelligence-archive-television-bbc4){target="_blank"} are available in my post on the BBC R&D blog ([archived](/assets/docs/madebymachine.pdf){target="_blank"} here).

The programme [was broadcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwk3p){target="_blank"} on BBC Four in September 2018. We also [published a paper](https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0114.html){target="_blank"} on the project (in collaboration with [Daniel Chavez Herras](http://elusivepixel.com/about/){target="_blank"} from Kings College London) at the Digital Humanities Conference 2019.
