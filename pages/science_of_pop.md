I contributed to the BBC Four documentary _[The Secret Science of Pop](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08gk664){target="_blank"}_, working with a team of experts from the BBC, Imperial College London, QMUL and Oxford University to analyse the history of recorded pop music, and investigate whether data science and machine learning techniques can predict what makes a song a hit – somewhat unsurprisingly, the results were inconclusive.
