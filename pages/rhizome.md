Rhizome is a prototype virtual reality experience, produced as part of my work for [Cenatus](https://cenatus.org/){target="_blank"} on [Creative xR audio research and development](https://cenatus.org/blog/26-creative-industries-fund-2021){target="_blank"}, funded by the [Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk){target="_blank"} Creative Industries Fund 2021.

Rhizome is an attempt to make visible and audible the hidden life of information networks, as well as to prompt reflection on the invisible care and maintenance that ensures the life of such networks and infrastructure in the real world. Inspired by the working of [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network){target="_blank"} in the natural world, it presents a forest of communicating nodes which use sound and light to guide the participant to care and sustain the ecosystem in which they find themselves.

VR version available for viewing or exhibition on request.
