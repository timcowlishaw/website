A generative video made for my friends [The Leaf Library](https://theleaflibrary.bandcamp.com/){target="_blank"}'s track "An Edge, An Ending", take from their EP "[About Minerals](https://innerspacetravels.bandcamp.com/album/about-minerals){target="_blank"}".

The concept came from some experiments playing around with crystalline forms that grow and respond to sound. The way the crystal slowly evolves from the smooth shape at the start fits the progression of the track nicely, whilst also seeming subtly melancholy to me – this complex shape struggling to emerge from smoothness and uniformity. The blues and greys came from hints that the band gave me regarding the inspiration for the tracks on the album. It was only afterwards I noticed the album title – a nice bit of serendipity! The video was made in the [Processing](https://processing.org/){target="_blank"} graphics programming environment, using the [minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/){target="_blank"} library for sound analysis, [HeMesh](https://github.com/wblut/HE_Mesh){target="_blank"} for 3D geometry and [PeasyCam](http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/){target="_blank"} for camera and lighting.
