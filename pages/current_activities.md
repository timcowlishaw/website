### Current Activities

_(Inspired by [Justin](https://justinpickard.net/compost/current-activities/){target="_blank"}, a way of "breaking cover" on work in progress, holding myself accountable for it, and giving visibility to activities that don't necessarily look or feel like "projects" as such.)_

 - Plugging away at my PhD: at the moment this involves writing up a literature review of existing work on digital waste and the ecology of computing, planning a study of how ICT sustainability is understood in practice in a university data centre, and beginning to think about participatory techniques for imagining different, more sustainable digital infrastructures (with a view to running some workshops early next year).

 - Collaborating with [Justin](https://justinpickard.net/){target="_blank"} on [Enxaneta](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta){target="_blank"}, our ongoing Anthropology--for--Computer--Science skill exchange, and a number of smaller sub-projects spinning out of it, including [Xamota](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/activities/xamota/xamota_living_description.md){target="_blank"} -- some experiments in methods and tools for "doing ethnography through writing software" in a manner loosely inspired by ethnographic film-making, and [Humus](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus){target="_blank"}, a speculative "composting database".

 - Working with [Maia](https://maiafrancisco.com/){target="_blank"} on software and sounds for a collaborative performance exploring material resonance and pure sound through live-code, piano and guitar.

 - Tentatively starting an installation project with [Gerard](https://www.gerardboyer.info/){target="_blank"} examining the ways in which [Tarragona's petrochemical industry](https://chemicalparks.eu/companies/port-of-tarragona){target="_blank"} and its environmental impacts are hidden or made visible, and its role in the broader community.

 - Working with [FabLab BCN](https://fablabbcn.org/){target="_blank"}, designing and building the [Distributed Design Learning Hub](https://learn.distributeddesign.eu/){target="_blank"}, as well as keeping [Make Works](https://make.works/){target="_blank"} and [SmartCitizen](https://smartcitizen.me/){target="_blank"} running and (hopefully!) steadily improving.

 - Lecturing at [BAU](https://www.baued.es){target="_blank"} on the [Master's degree in Design Research](https://www.baued.es/en/studies/masters-and-postgraduate-degrees/masters-degree-in-design-research){target="_blank"}.

 - Preparing a presentation on using [Discard Studies](https://discardstudies.com/){target="_blank"} as a speculative design method for the ["Expandiendo los Márgenes" conference](https://designconferenceuoc.net/){target="_blank"} at [UOC](https://www.uoc.edu/en){target="_blank"} in December.

 - Otherwise I'm mostly practicing guitar, trying to slowly increase the amount of Catalan I speak in my day-to-day life, and oscillating between reading lots of STS and anthropology literature, and lots of spy thrillers.
