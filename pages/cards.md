### Cards Against Television (2017)
#### Project with BBC R&D

One of my first projects with BBC R&D as part of the Tellybox project, overseen by my incredible friend and colleague [Libby Miller](https://planb.nicecupoftea.org/){target="_blank"} (who basically taught me everything I know).

"[Tellybox](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/tellybox){target="_blank"}" was a speculative prototyping project investigating the ways in which people choose television programmes while watching _together_ with others, and the social role that TV plays in their lives. We used the game mechanics of a co-operative card game to investigate the sources of tension and conflict when choosing TV programmes with others, and identify means of resolving them – before extending the game to allow it to be used to _actually make programme choices_, using RFID tags on the cards and a prototype set-top-box running on a Raspberry Pi.

We presented this work at the [V&A Digital Design Weekend 2016](https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/museum-life/digital-design-weekend-2016){target="_blank"}, and at [TVX 2017](https://tvx.acm.org/2017/){target="_blank"}. With further development from the rest of the team, this eventually morphed into the [5-2-1 Tellybox prototype on BBC Taster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/tellybox-521){target="_blank"}.
