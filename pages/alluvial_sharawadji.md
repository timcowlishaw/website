[Alluvial Sharawadji](https://sharawadji.cat/){target="_blank"} was a crowdsourced interactive artwork/workshop by myself and my friend and collaborator [Jakub Fiala](https://fiala.uk/){target="_blank"} for [Eufonic festival](https://eufonic.net/en/){target="_blank"} 2018, combining collaborative field recording with low-cost, ubiquitous web technologies to communicate the experience of a local sound environment to audiences who are distant in both time and space.

Drawing on [Claude Shryer](https://electrocd.com/en/artiste/schryer_cl/Claude_Schryer){target="_blank"}’s idea of ‘[Sharawadji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharawadji_effect){target="_blank"}’ – the action of “tending an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context." this work takes the alluvial action of the Ebre river’s flow (transporting material through time and space to create new deposits and forms) as a metaphor for the movement of participants through the festival soundscape, gathering and depositing elements of the sound-world for later experience by others.
