<p><em>I remember when all of this was just fields</em> is a Firefox
extension that checks if the site you’re looking at is hosted in one of
the three datacentres in Zaragoza that make up the AWS Spain region
(eu-south-2), and if it is, redirects you to a lovely image of when all
this was just fields.</p>
<p>I made this as part of a larger piece of work investigating the AWS
Spain region, using open-source investigation techniques to identify the
location of the three data centres in the Zaragoza region, attempting to
map out their sources of power and water, and better understand their
links to local communities and ecosystems. One particular challenge was
to identify the sites and applications hosted within it - for obvious
reasons, there is no way of getting a list of clients from Amazon
itself. However, by using the public list of AWS IP addresses, we can
start to slowly get an idea of what these three massive warehouses
contain during our day to day browsing, through the use of this
extension.</p>
<p>The extension source code is <a
