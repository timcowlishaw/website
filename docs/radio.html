<p>What does it mean for a media service to be “personalised?” In the
world of the commercial streaming platforms this tends to mean that the
service provides some sort of personalised <em>recommendations</em> –
looking at your listening or watching history to identify more media
that you’re likely to spend time consuming. This makes sense for them –
they’ve got a clear incentive to maximise the time their audience spend
with them (especially if they’re ad-funded!), however this isn’t
necessarily true in a public service context. When we don’t rely on an
ever increasing number of people, spending an ever increasing amount of
time with us, for our continuing survival as an organisation – perhaps
we have an opportunity to do things differently!</p>
<p>This project was an investigation into how personalised services can
be reconciled with the normative and ethical principles of public
service broadcasting, and how public service broadcasters such as the
BBC can use our special status to produce distinctive, novel services
that benefit our users.</p>
<p>I led the team working on this project (which consisted of myself,
Jakub Fiala, David Man and Todd Burlington, supported by some early
design ethics insight from the incredible <a
href="https://www.cennydd.com/" target="_blank">Cennydd Bowles</a>).</p>
<p>We investigated how personalised media services can be made
<em>transparent</em>, can ensure <em>diversity</em>, can <em>respect
user agency</em>, and can <em>preserve a communal experience of
media</em>, through a prototyping process which delivered a fully
working web-based personalised radio prototype, based on a novel
recommendation algorithm that we designed and developed.</p>
