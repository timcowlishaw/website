<p><em>(Inspired by <a
href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/current-activities/"
target="_blank">Justin</a>, a way of “breaking cover” on work in
progress, holding myself accountable for it, and giving visibility to
activities that don’t necessarily look or feel like “projects” as
such.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plugging away at my PhD: at the moment this involves writing up a
literature review of existing work on digital waste and the ecology of
computing, planning a study of how ICT sustainability is understood in
practice in a university data centre, and beginning to think about
participatory techniques for imagining different, more sustainable
digital infrastructures (with a view to running some workshops early
next year).</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborating with <a href="https://justinpickard.net/"
target="_blank">Justin</a> on <a
href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta"
target="_blank">Enxaneta</a>, our ongoing
Anthropology–for–Computer–Science skill exchange, and a number of
smaller sub-projects spinning out of it, including <a
href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/activities/xamota/xamota_living_description.md"
target="_blank">Xamota</a> – some experiments in methods and tools for
“doing ethnography through writing software” in a manner loosely
inspired by ethnographic film-making, and <a
href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus" target="_blank">Humus</a>,
a speculative “composting database”.</p></li>
<li><p>Working with <a href="https://maiafrancisco.com/"
target="_blank">Maia</a> on software and sounds for a collaborative
performance exploring material resonance and pure sound through
live-code, piano and guitar.</p></li>
<li><p>Tentatively starting an installation project with <a
href="https://www.gerardboyer.info/" target="_blank">Gerard</a>
examining the ways in which <a
href="https://chemicalparks.eu/companies/port-of-tarragona"
target="_blank">Tarragona’s petrochemical industry</a> and its
environmental impacts are hidden or made visible, and its role in the
broader community.</p></li>
<li><p>Working with <a href="https://fablabbcn.org/"
target="_blank">FabLab BCN</a>, designing and building the <a
href="https://learn.distributeddesign.eu/" target="_blank">Distributed
Design Learning Hub</a>, as well as keeping <a
href="https://make.works/" target="_blank">Make Works</a> and <a
href="https://smartcitizen.me/" target="_blank">SmartCitizen</a> running
and (hopefully!) steadily improving.</p></li>
<li><p>Lecturing at <a href="https://www.baued.es"
target="_blank">BAU</a> on the <a
href="https://www.baued.es/en/studies/masters-and-postgraduate-degrees/masters-degree-in-design-research"
target="_blank">Master’s degree in Design Research</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing a presentation on using <a
href="https://discardstudies.com/" target="_blank">Discard Studies</a>
as a speculative design method for the <a
href="https://designconferenceuoc.net/" target="_blank">“Expandiendo los
Márgenes” conference</a> at <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/en"
target="_blank">UOC</a> in December.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise I’m mostly practicing guitar, trying to slowly increase
the amount of Catalan I speak in my day-to-day life, and oscillating
between reading lots of STS and anthropology literature, and lots of spy
thrillers.</p></li>
