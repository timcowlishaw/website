<p>During my time at BBC R&amp;D, Cassian Harrison, Controller of BBC
Four, challenged us to produce a one-hour documentary programme,
assembled from existing archive clips, entirely using machine learning
techniques:</p>

<p>This was an interesting exercise in testing the limits of
computational creativity, and in the use of machine learning on media to
educate a non-specialist public about the technology, it’s strengths,
weaknesses, and possible risks.</p>
<p>Alongside my editorial colleague Caroline Alton, I led the team which
put the film together: investigating, devising and implementing the
machine learning technology which produced the film itself.</p>
<p>We used a variety of different approaches to do this, including
computer vision and natural language processing, techniques, as well as
adapting recent deep neural network-based sequence learning techniques
to model the sequence of transmissions in our film. <a

<p>The programme <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwk3p"

<a href="https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0114.html"
target="_blank">published a paper</a> on the project (in collaboration
with <a href="http://elusivepixel.com/about/" target="_blank">Daniel
Chavez Herras</a> from Kings College London) at the Digital Humanities
Conference 2019.</p></main>
