<p>One of my first projects with BBC R&amp;D as part of the Tellybox
project, overseen by my incredible friend and colleague <a

(who basically taught me everything I know).</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/projects/tellybox"
target="_blank">Tellybox</a>” was a speculative prototyping project
investigating the ways in which people choose television programmes
while watching <em>together</em> with others, and the social role that
TV plays in their lives. We used the game mechanics of a co-operative
card game to investigate the sources of tension and conflict when
choosing TV programmes with others, and identify means of resolving them
– before extending the game to allow it to be used to <em>actually make
programme choices</em>, using RFID tags on the cards and a prototype
set-top-box running on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>We presented this work at the <a
href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/museum-life/digital-design-weekend-2016"
target="_blank">V&amp;A Digital Design Weekend 2016</a>, and at <a
href="https://tvx.acm.org/2017/" target="_blank">TVX 2017</a>. With
further development from the rest of the team, this eventually morphed
into the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/pilots/tellybox-521"
target="_blank">5-2-1 Tellybox prototype on BBC Taster</a>.</p></main>
