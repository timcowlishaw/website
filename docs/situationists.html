<p>Produced in collaboration with Matt Spendlove as part of our work for
<a href="https://cenatus.org/" target="_blank">Cenatus</a> on <a
href="https://cenatus.org/blog/26-creative-industries-fund-2021"
target="_blank">Creative xR audio research and development</a>, funded
by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk"

href="https://cenatus.org/blog/28-the-situationists-walkman---an-audio-augmented-reality-experience"
target="_blank">The Situationists Walkman</a> is</em> an audio-only
augmented-reality experience – a site-specific interactive sound art
exhibit involving 9 invited artists, that exists completely virtually –
delivered entirely through headphones and an iPhone app.</p>
<p>Conceptually, we were interested in creating a playful, non-directed
experience that offered surprising, uncanny sonic augmentation to the
world around you. Using the city as a playground – a canvas upon which
we could project directed audio stimulus that’s unconstrained by the
physicality and hardware of a gallery setting, augmenting familiar
surroundings with another layer of perceptual information. A 3D
graphical score with a participant conductor.</p>
<p>One particular reference we kept returning to was the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International"
target="_blank">Situationist</a> idea of the <em>dérive – “a mode of
experimental behaviour linked to the conditions of urban society: a
technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.”</em> – an
undirected, spontaneous exploration of the urban environment. This
seemed particularly germane during the months in which we were working
on this project – Facebook had just announced their “metaverse” strategy
and rebrand, and a lot of the commentary and discourse around the
announcement (as well as other <a href="http://hyper-reality.co"
target="_blank">artistic references</a> we’d been inspired by) were
concerned with the possibility that AR technologies might lead to
further enclosure and commercialisation of public spaces. In this
context, the idea that we might use the project both as an exploration
of both the playful, open-ended possibilities of the technology for
artistic expression, and a means of celebrating the importance of open
public spaces and expanding them into AR-space, made the idea of a
situationist-like intervention even more pertinent.</p>
<p>The result was <em>The Situationists’ Walkman</em> – a <em>digital
dérive</em>, playing out within a small area of East London around
Arnold Circus. An updated version of the Situationists’ vision using
audio led exploration of the urban environment that prompts us to
reconsider our relationship to this constructed or delineated space.</p>
<p>In addition, I contributed one of the sound works featured in the
exhibition, in collaboration with singer Constanza Piffardi. Based on a
<a

target="_blank">fragment of traditional folk song sung by an ex-resident
of the Boundary Estate</a>, found in the British Library sound archive,
we produced a new piece for voice and electronics:</p>
