<p><strong>2021 – 2024 (estimated completion date) – PhD, Design and
Communication, BAU School of Art and Design, Barcelona.</strong></p>
<p>My thesis investigates the phenomenon of <em>digital waste</em> from
an ecological perspective. I’m particularly interested in the ways in
which the ways in which we discard digital things (in the sense of
files, software, data, media) have consequences for how we discard
physical devices (i.e. e-waste), and the use of energy, water, and other
material resources by digital media. I also examine in the ways in which
interaction design practices are entangled with these materialities.
It’s a practice research project, and draws on design research, discard
studies, STS, and the environmental humanities.</p>
<p><strong>2010 – 2011: MSc, Computer Science, University College London
(with distinction), London, UK</strong></p>
<p>Including specialisations in: Human-Computer Interaction, Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence, information retrieval, and social
simulation.</p>
<p><strong>2002 – 2005: BA, Moving Image Design, Ravensbourne College of
Design and Communication, London, UK</strong></p>
<p>Including: graphic design, animation, typography, research skills,
critical and contextual studies.</p>
<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>
<p><strong>September 2021 – present: Sessional lecturer, BAU University
Center of Art and Design, Barcelona, Spain</strong></p>
<p>I teach several classes and practical workshops of the Speculative
and Critical Design module of the Master’s Degree in Design
Research.</p>
<p><strong>December 2010 – today: Freelance researcher, designer and
developer, London, UK and Barcelona, Spain</strong></p>
<p>A variety of work for diverse clients, including the BBC, the UK
National Archives, smartcitizen.me, and the Barcelona community radio
network (XRCB). I have taken responsibility for design, prototyping,
research and programming of different projects – websites, applications,
prototypes, artistic installations and data analysis and visualisation
projects.</p>
<p><strong>April 2016 – November 2019: Producer / Technologist /
Researcher – Research and Development department, British Broadcasting
Corporation, London, UK</strong></p>
<p>I worked in a small interdisciplinary team designing, prototyping,
and delivering new online services and products, with a focus on the
discovery of information and content – its search, recommendation and
analysis. During my last 18 months there, I led the discovery team –
managing projects, supervising other team members and initiating new
projects and fields of research, and communicating our results and
projects to internal and external audiences, through articles, talks and
workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Featured projects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A prototype of a personalised radio service that demonstrated an
algorithm designed to reflect the organisation’s public service values,
and functioned as a proof of concept for a more general ethical design
process.</li>
<li>The delivery and broadcast of ‘Made by Machine’ – the first
television program made by an artificial intelligence.</li>
<li>A large-scale mixed methods study conducted with collaborators at
the University of Manchester, which investigated how our audience’s
media consumption habits affected their level of political knowledge and
efficacy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>May 2015 – March 2016: PhD student and teaching assistant,
University College London, London, UK</strong></p>
<p>An ultimately abortive attempt to obtain a PhD in Computer Science,
working at the intersection of the fields of machine learning,
human-computer interaction (HCI), and information retrieval.</p>
