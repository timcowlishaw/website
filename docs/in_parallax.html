<p>An immersive work combining projection, virtual reality and sound,
commissioned for the New York Museum of the Moving Image’s retrospective
on artist, filmmaker and inventor, Jose Val del Omar: <a
href="https://movingimage.us/event/cinema-of-sensations/"
target="_blank">Cinema of Sensations: The Never-Ending Screen of Val del
Omar</a>.</p>
<p>Sally was commissioned to respond to the work of Jose Val del Omar
and invited Matt and I to collaborate with her. The resulting work,
<em>In Parallax</em> draws on Val del Omar’s idea of the technique of
<em>desbordamiento panorámico</em> (apanoramic overflowing) of the
screen which Val del Omar used to great effect in his own work –
attempting to extrapolate his technique of visual overflow into three
dimensions with an installation that blended an immersive VR environment
with projections and sound in the gallery space.</p>
<p>Beyond just being inspired by specific devices or techniques in Val
del Omar’s work, we were specifically drawn to his particular background
and perspective as both an artist and an inventor – one whose work
prefigured specific technical advances in audiovisual capture and
reproduction – the zoom lens and surround sound in particular – and
whose work as an artist and as a technician are inseparable – his
artistic work functioning as a material exploration of his medium,
driven by his technical insights, and his inventive work in turn
responding, from necessity, to the limitations of the medium as a
vehicle for his singular artistic vision.</p>
<p>This prompted a sort of methodological inspiration – how could we
approach our own media in a way which was informed by Val del Omar’s
approach? we came to see this as a form of practical <a
href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520262744/media-archaeology"
target="_blank"><em>media archaeology</em></a> – tracing the origins and
material history of the technologies we were working with back to the
stereoscope and zoopraxiscope and using our work to speculate about
other trajectories of technological development which would aesthetic
and sensorial experiences over representation and call into question the
claim that virtual, augmented and extended ‘reality’ technologies make
to be representational.</p></main>
