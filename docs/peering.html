<p><em>Peering</em> is a short article submitted for the <em><a
href="https://sflab.eecs.kth.se/pub/pj7s6ahe/release/6"
target="_blank">Liminal Excavations</a></em> zine, made to acocompany
the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/ict4s-2024"
target="_blank">ICT4S 2024</a> conference in Stockholm, and which
partially documents an ongoing project to map the physical location and
material support of a single accidental photo stored in my Google
account.</p>
<p><em>Where do the traces of our digital lives come from, and where do
they reside? We’ve all likely experienced a moment when we’ve
encountered an accidental photograph, a screenshot, or other fragment of
media, residing on our phone camera-roll, or in a cloud account,
nominally ‘ours’ but with no memory of how it came to be there. This
graphical essay explores treats the existence of this digital detritus
as a mystery to be solved, and one which, in the solving, can reveal to
us not just the extent of the unintentional digital that we leave, but
the enormity of the underlying infrastructures which support our
day-to-day digital lives and their interdependency with broader
ecologies of energy, water, and data - as well as the way in which our
own use of digital devices is implicated in them. Starting from a single
‘accidental selfie’, discovered in my Google Photos account, I attempt
to answer the questions “Where is this photo, how did it come to be
there, and what does it rely on for its continued existence?”. Using a
combination of digital methods, literature review (drawing on the work
of Anne Pasek, Mél Hogan, Tung-Hui Hu, and others from the fields of
Environmental Media Studies and STS), open-source investigation and
shoe-leather fieldwork, I map out the history and ecological
entanglements of my photo and the data centre in which it resides (a
Google / Telefónica facility in Alcalá de Henares, Madrid). This process
allows me to consider both the extent of the infrastructures underlying
such every day interactions with digital platforms, but also the
epistemic challenges which we face in coming to know them from an
outside perspective, and allows me to meditate on my own role as a user
of digital technology in its environmental and ecological consequences
and draw conclusions on how, as end-users, we might play a part in
ameliorating and resisting the polluting effects of digital
technology.</em></p>
