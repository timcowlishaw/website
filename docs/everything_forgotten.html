<p><em>(This text is a fragment I had to cut from <a
href="https://www.inmaterialdesign.com/INM/article/view/142"
target="_blank">a paper in Inmaterial</a>, but which I rather liked, and
which I felt put this project – which I never really considered to be a
finished ‘work’ – in enough context that I felt happy sharing it.
Therefore, I’m keeping it for posterity here).</em></p>
<p>Since July 2021 I have been carrying out an autoethnographic study of
my own digital discard practices, keeping a reflective journal of what I
choose to delete or save, when, and in what circumstances I make such
choices, and my reasons for doing so. I chose to start with a piece of
reflexive research for several related reasons: As an exercise in
critical reflection as research in its own right, but also as a pilot
for potential future ethnographic research with a wider set of
participants. The idea of performing a pilot study on myself seemed of
paramount importance when dealing with digital discards, as a question
of research ethics – I suspected early on in the genesis of my research
that the act of deleting a digital object might often stem from a desire
to prevent the sharing or recall of that object – to prevent something
private, intimate or secret being encountered by others, or something
with painful or otherwise negative associations being encountered by
ourselves. As such, the idea of performing a study investigating digital
discards leads to both privacy and safeguarding concerns, hence my
decision to begin with a reflexive investigation, in order to probe
these questions further. I was assisted in this process by a small
computer program I wrote which replaced the ‘trashcan’ icon on my
laptop, logging metadata about each file I deleted (it’s name, location
&amp; type as well as the date and time of its creation and deletion) as
prompts for later reflection, as well as silently archiving each deleted
file, in order to produce a repository of unwanted digital objects for
later use as part of speculative design and prototyping exercises.</p>
<p>One aspect of my own discard practices, and my relationship to my own
digital discards that I noticed through this process, is that, while my
initial hunch that my decisions to delete a file would be related to the
desire to forget or withhold a memory was often correct – this desire
was not necessarily fixed – I often found myself regretting or
questioning these decisions, or finding delight or serendipity through
my recall of a previously forgotten, discarded object.</p>
<p>Of course, these re-encounters with deleted files were to some extent
the result of a flaw in my methodology – by archiving my deleted files
as research artefacts they were never truly deleted – but this reflects
a commonplace about digital technology – that ‘nothing is ever truly
deleted’ (see, for example, Onuoha 2017). The act of deleting a file
simply marks the space it occupies as ‘free’ for future use, and as more
data is written to the same device, it is gradually overwritten and
corrupted – decaying to make way for something new in a manner analogous
to composting.</p>
<p>I decided to attempt to probe my reactions to reencounters with
deleted files further, as well as attempting to find a way of making
this process of digital composting visible, via the form of a
screensaver.  Screensavers hold a particular fascination for me due to
the fact that they are, by definition, <em>use-less</em> – they are only
roused when the computer is in an idle state – not being used for some
instrumental purpose – “No action is possible except inaction” (Forcier
2021). In addition, the screensaver seemed an appropriate medium to
explore the gradual processes of overwriting, decay and corruption going
on within the machine itself due to their boundless, ongoing nature –
which, as Kaitlyn Clifton Forcier has argued “articulates a logic of
endlessness that is associated with the emergence of networked digital
culture.” (ibid).</p>
<p>My screensaver, named <em>Everything we had forgotten was indeed
lost<sup><a href="#notes-1">1</a></sup>,</em> when activated, iterates
through every image file in the trash on my computer, presenting it on
the screen, while simultaneously overwriting it with a small amount of
noise – randomly changing pixels or lines so that the image decays
gradually over time, in a manner analogous to physical decay. This both
confronts me with my deletion history, allowing me the capacity to be
surprised or to question my own previous decisions, as well as allowing
a for a period of repentance, in which i can recover an
only-slightly-damaged copy of a file I might find myself regretting
deleting. Over time however, all is irretrievably gone forever, absorbed
by entropy, affording a finality to this deletion process and the
possibility of renewal. This ongoing process places me into a
relationship of <em>intimate participation</em> (Bataille, 1988) with
the deletion algorithm – its visibility means that my choice to
intervene by ‘rescuing’ a file or not, comes to matter.</p>
