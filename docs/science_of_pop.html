<p>I contributed to the BBC Four documentary <em><a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08gk664" target="_blank">The
Secret Science of Pop</a></em>, working with a team of experts from the
BBC, Imperial College London, QMUL and Oxford University to analyse the
history of recorded pop music, and investigate whether data science and
machine learning techniques can predict what makes a song a hit –
somewhat unsurprisingly, the results were inconclusive.</p></main>
